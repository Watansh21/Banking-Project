The banking project is a console-based application developed in C++. It provides minimal features of a banking system, allowing users to perform various operations on their accounts. Here are the key points about this project:

The application is menu-driven, presenting users with options to open an account, check balances, deposit/withdraw funds, close an account, and view account details.
Account information, including account number, first name, last name, and balance, is stored in a file for data persistence.
The project utilizes classes such as Account and Bank to manage accounts and their operations effectively.
Automatic assignment of account numbers is implemented to ensure unique identifiers for each account.
Users can open accounts by providing their first name, last name, and initial balance, with the account number generated automatically.
Balancing query allows users to check the balance of a specific account by entering the account number.
Deposit and withdraw options enable users to add or subtract funds from their accounts, respectively.
The application supports closing an account, removing it from the system, based on the specified account number.
The "Show all accounts" option displays the details of all existing accounts stored in the application.
The project ensures that the account data is saved in a file, allowing retrieval of the information when the application is relaunched.
The code includes classes like Account and Bank, as well as their member functions, constructors, accessors, and static functions.
File handling is implemented using input/output stream operators to store and retrieve account data from files.
The program demonstrates the usage of map containers to store and manage multiple accounts efficiently.
In summary, the banking system project provides a user-friendly interface for basic banking operations, maintains account data persistence, and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts to achieve efficient and organized code.
